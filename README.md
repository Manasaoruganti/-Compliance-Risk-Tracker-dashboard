# -**Compliance-Risk-Tracker-dashboard**
Audit-Compliance-Risk-Monitoring-Dashboard-ETL-Python-PowerBI
An analytics pipeline for fraud detection, compliance (SOX/GDPR), transactional risk visualization, and audit-tailored insights.


🧠 **Why This Project Matters**
This project exemplifies a comprehensive analytics solution that mirrors real-world enterprise needs—spanning data engineering, risk intelligence, compliance analytics, and interactive reporting. It's built to support internal audit, enterprise risk, and compliance teams with actionable, real-time insights and anomaly alerts.

🔍 **Project Summary**
A full-scale analytics pipeline that automates financial fraud detection, flags compliance violations (SOX/GDPR), and visualizes transactional risk using advanced Power BI dashboards. The system processes raw financial records, applies machine learning for anomaly detection, and delivers visually compelling insights tailored for audit and risk professionals.

🚀** Key Features**
🔄 ETL Pipeline: Extracts, transforms, and loads financial data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy) and SQL.

⚠️ Anomaly Detection: Leverages Isolation Forest to detect suspicious/high-risk transactions.

✅ Compliance Checks: Applies regulatory logic to flag SOX and GDPR violations.

📈 Interactive Dashboards: Power BI dashboards designed with DAX to show:

Transaction distribution by region & type (Credit, Debit, Transfer)

Risk score and compliance status per transaction

Trends in high-risk activity over time

Breakdown of compliance issues (Compliant, SOX Violation, Fraud Alert)

🔁 Automation Ready: Built to support scheduling via Task Scheduler (Windows) or Cron Jobs (Linux) for automated refreshes.
